### General:

This project was mainly developed by

* Alberto Garcia (SAX, XPATH, WXML, Overall design)
* Jon Wakelin, Alberto Garcia (DOM subsystem)
* Jon Wakelin, (CML writing subsystem)
* Mart Reentmeester (STRINGS).

New stuff coming:
* [Roland Siegbert](http://www.cats.rwth-aachen.de/Members/siegbert) (CMake migration).

*Probably* it makes more sense to use the successor
[FoX](http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~walker/FoX/), maintained by Andrew Walker.
However, I used this already and decided to enhance the running system. ;-)

This is a beta version of xmlf90-1.2, which contains significant
new features. Please see the file Tutorial/Guide.html and
the ReleaseNotes-1.2 file.
